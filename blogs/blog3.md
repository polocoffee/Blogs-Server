## Nature’s Most Impressive Animal Migrations

Migration is a natural phenomenon that has fascinated humans for centuries and is important to ecosystem health.

### Frequent Flyer

Arctic terns (Sterna paradisaea) are small, plain-looking birds, weighing between 90–120 grams (3.2–4.2 ounces) with a wing span of 64–76 centimeters (25.2–29.9 inches). To the untrained eye, they do not look as if they are built for endurance, but these birds take the trophy for the longest migration of any animal in the world.

Flying from pole to pole, Arctic terns spend most of their year at sea chasing a perpetual summer. Seasons are reversed in the Northern and Southern hemispheres, so as winter approaches in their Arctic breeding grounds, the terns head south to the Antarctic where summer is just beginning. Arctic terns are believed to migrate around 40,000 kilometers (25,000 miles) a year, but a recent scientific study suggests that they might fly double that distance.

### Multigenerational Relay

Perhaps one of the most famous migrations is the multi-generational round trip of the monarch butterfly. Monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) can be found all over the United States and further afield, but it is the northeastern American population that is famous for making the 4,800-kilometer (3,000-mile) journey from Canada to Mexico.

Each year, millions of monarch butterflies leave their northern ranges and fly south to the oyamel fir forests near the Sierra Madre mountains, where they gather in huge roosts to survive the winter. When spring arrives, the monarchs start their return journey north; the population cycles through three to five generations to reach their destination. Along the way, females lay eggs on milkweed plants, which the caterpillars use for food after hatching. This new generation of butterflies complete the journey their great-great-great-grandparents started. It is still a mystery to scientists how the new generations know where to go, but they appear to navigate using a combination of the Earth’s magnetic field and the position of the sun.
