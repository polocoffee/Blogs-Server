## Endangered Species

An endangered species is a plant, animal, fungus, microbe, or other organism that is threatened by extinction. Species become endangered for two main reasons: loss of habitat and loss of genetic variation.

### Loss of Habitat

A loss of habitat can happen naturally. Dinosaurs, for instance, lost their habitat about 66 million years ago. The hot, dry climate of the Cretaceous period changed very quickly, most likely because of an asteroid striking the Earth. The impact of the asteroid forced debris into the atmosphere, reducing the amount of heat and light that reached Earth’s surface. The dinosaurs were unable to adapt to this new, cooler habitat. Dinosaurs became endangered and then extinct.

Human activity can also contribute to a loss of habitat. Development of housing, industry and agriculture reduces the habitat of native organisms. This can happen in a number of different ways.

Development can eliminate habitats and native species directly. In South America, human activities have resulted in the clearing of about 20 percent of the Amazon rainforest in the last 50 years. When a piece of land is “cleared,” all trees and vegetation are removed. The Amazon rainforest has been cleared primarily for cattle ranches in order to meet the worldwide demand for beef.

Development can also endanger species indirectly. Some species may provide a habitat for other species. As trees are destroyed, species that depend on that tree for their habitat may also become endangered. Tree crowns provide a habitat in the canopy, or top layer, of a rainforest. Plants and insects, such as vines and butterflies, live in the rainforest canopy, as do hundreds of species of tropical birds and mammals, such as monkeys. When trees are cut down, this habitat is lost, and species have less room to live and reproduce.

A species may also be important to the people of an area. Strangler fig trees (Ficus species), found in rainforests around the world, are important to some indigenous groups. For centuries, indigenous people have been preserving fig trees due to their religious and cultural beliefs surrounding the trees. These beliefs have created taboos, or restrictions, that end up protecting the trees by forbidding harm to them. Though indigenous groups have taken steps to protect fig trees, developers often still destroy these trees to build more cattle ranches.
