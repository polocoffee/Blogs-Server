### What Is Hibernation?

Despite what you may have heard, species that hibernate don’t “sleep” during the winter.  

Hibernation is an extended form of torpor, a state where metabolism is depressed to less than five percent of normal. “Most of the physiological functions are extremely slowed down or completely halted,” says Marina Blanco, a postdoctoral associate at the Duke Lemur Center in Durham, North Carolina, United States, who studies the dwarf lemurs (Cheirogaleus spp.) of Madagascar—the only primates that hibernate on a regular schedule.

For example, when dwarf lemurs hibernate, they reduce their heart rates from over 300 beats per minute to fewer than six, Blanco says. And instead of breathing about every second, they can go up to 10 minutes without taking a breath. Their brain activity “becomes undetectable.”

This is very different from sleep, which is a gentle resting state where unconscious functions are still performed. In fact, Blanco’s research has found that hibernators have to undergo periodic arousals so they can catch some sleep!

### Why Do Animals Hibernate?

Put simply: “Hibernation is a means of energy conservation,” says Kelly Drew, a neuropharmacologist at the University of Alaska Fairbanks in the United States. She studies the brain chemistry of hibernating Arctic ground squirrels (Spermophilus parryii).

While hibernation is most often seen as a seasonal behavior, it’s not exclusive to cold-weather critters. There are tropical hibernators that may do so to stay cool in the heat.
