## Wildlife Crossings

Bridges and tunnels specifically designed for animals can reduce the environmental impact of highways.

### Elk Crossing

Elk (Cervus canadensis) gather in bunches to cross the road all at once. Hitting a large animal like an elk is dangerous for the animal and the person driving the car.

Roadkill is a serious problem in motor transportation. Crossing deer and other large mammals can create life-threatening hazards on roadways. In the United States alone, there are more than a million automobile accidents per year involving wildlife, racking up more than $8 billion in medical costs and vehicle repairs annually.

### More than A Million Animals Killed Every Day

If your point of view considers the well-being of wildlife, the problem is greatly magnified. According to some estimates, automobile collisions kill more than a million animals every day, making them the leading cause of death for many vertebrate species. Still worse is the way major roads and other forms of development can subdivide animal populations and fragment their habitats. Losing access to large areas of their living space makes it much harder for many woodland creatures to forage for food, find mates and carry on their genetic legacies.

As people have become more aware of these dangers, one strategy to mitigate them has gradually gained acceptance: human-made highway crossings designed just for animals. These can come in many forms, depending on the species involved and the geographic features of the land. The most common forms of wildlife crossing are bridges and overpasses, tunnels, viaducts and culverts. Features of this kind are increasingly included in highway planning and road improvement schemes. When successfully implemented, they can greatly reduce the likelihood of collisions, provide a safe corridor for animal transit and help reduce the ecological impact of highways by reconnecting animal habitats.

### Green Bridges

Wildlife bridges, often called "green bridges" in the United Kingdom, are usually covered in native vegetation of various kinds. This is to make them appear like a natural part of the landscape and help invite animal passage. The crossings often work most effectively in conjunction with highway fencing, placed strategically on one or both sides of the entrance to funnel wildlife toward the corridor.
