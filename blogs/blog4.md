## Plant and Animal Reproduction

While all organisms reproduce, not all organisms reproduce the same way. Explore the similar and different ways that plants and animals pass on their genes.

### Lion-tailed Macaque Family

Sexual reproduction, by far the most common seen in animals, involves two parents of the opposite sex, each of whom contributes different genetic material to produce an offspring. Here, a lion-tailed macaque (Macaca silenus) mother and infant nestle in Western Ghats, India.

### What Is Reproduction?

All organisms reproduce, including plants and animals. The biological process involves an organism producing and/or giving birth to another organism. Just because all organisms reproduce doesnâ€™t mean the methods of reproduction are the same, however. Plants and animals occupy different phylogenetic kingdoms, but they have evolved reproductive systems that overlap and diverge from each other in several ways. Even within the same kingdom, different species may have different methods of reproduction.

### Types of Reproduction

There are two types of reproduction: asexual reproduction and sexual reproduction. The former involves a single parent that produces a genetically identical offspring, whereas the latter involves two parents of the opposite sex, each of whom contributes genetic material to produce a diverse offspring. Different plants and animal can reproduce either asexually or sexually; however, asexual reproduction is more common among plants than animals.

Asexual and sexual reproduction each have benefits and drawbacks. Organisms that reproduce asexually have the advantage of producing several genetically identical offspring quickly and with little energy. On the other hand, the lack of genetic diversity among asexual offspring means they have a lower chance of acclimating to an unstable environment. By contrast, organisms that reproduce sexually have the advantage of producing a genetically diverse offspring, which is able to adapt to its environment. But sexual reproduction comes at a cost, requiring more time and energy to produce an offspring than asexual
