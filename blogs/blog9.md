## Ecosystem

An ecosystem is a geographic area where plants, animals, and other organisms, as well as weather and landscapes, work together to form a bubble of life.

### Bison

An ecosystem is a geographic area where plants, animals, and other organisms, as well as weather and landscape, work together to form a bubble of life. Bison (Bison bison), sometimes mistakenly called buffalo, are a keystone species of the tallgrass prairie ecosystem of the Great Plains of the United States and Canada.

An ecosystem is a geographic area where plants, animals and other organisms, as well as weather and landscape, work together to form a bubble of life. Ecosystems contain biotic (living) factors, as well as abiotic (nonliving) factors. Biotic factors include plants, animals and other organisms. Abiotic factors include rocks, temperature and humidity.

Every part of an ecosystem depends on every other part, directly or indirectly. A change in the temperature of an ecosystem often affects what plants grow there, for instance. Animals that depend on plants for food and shelter have to adapt to the changes, move to another ecosystem or perish.

Ecosystems can be very large or very small. Tide pools, the ponds left by the ocean as the tide goes out, are complete, tiny ecosystems. Tide pools contain seaweed, a kind of algae that uses photosynthesis to create food. Herbivores, such as abalone (Haliotis), eat the seaweed. Carnivores, such as sea stars, eat other animals in the tide pool, such as clams or mussels. Tide pools depend on the changing level of ocean water. Organisms in the tide pool must be able to survive submersion in seawater and potentially crushing ocean currents when the tide comes in. When the tide goes back out, the organisms must survive sun exposure and hotter temperatures. Plants and animals in the tidepool have adaptations that help them survive. For example, seaweed has a protective coating to keep it from drying out in the sun. In this way, the biotic parts of the ecosystem depend on abiotic factors.
