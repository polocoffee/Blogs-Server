## Cracks in the Kalahari’s Emerald: Threats to the Okavango Delta

Many species of plants and animals live in the Okavango Delta, but their well-being, and the well-being of the environment itself, is under threat from human activities.

In the northwestern region of the African country of Botswana, in the northernmost part of the Kalahari Desert, lies an oasis called the Okavango Delta. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Heritage Centre and the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands of International Importance have deemed the Okavango Delta a site worthy of protection.

The Okavango Delta is home to almost 2,000 plant and animal species that depend on the habitats of the delta for survival. Many threatened and endangered species, including the African wild dog (Lycaon pictus), the southern ground-hornbill (Bucorvus leadbeateri), the black rhinoceros (Diceros bicornis), and the white rhinoceros (Ceratotherium simum), call this inland delta their home.

In addition to these animal populations, more than 100,000 people live in and around the Okavango Delta and depend on the resources it provides. The Okavango Delta Peoples of Botswana consist of five distinct ethnic groups: the Bugakwe, Dxeriku, Hambukushu, Wayeyi, and Xanekwe. Most people live on the outskirts of the delta, leaving huge uninhabited areas within it. Historically, some of these groups were grain farmers; others relied on hunting, gathering, and fishing to survive. Today, these indigenous groups continue to rely on subsistence farming, fishing, and other activities that have little impact on the environment or its ecosystems. There are, however, several other factors that threaten the integrity of the delta, including overdevelopment and poaching.

### Water and Land Threats

The government of Botswana protects the land within Okavango Delta, but environmentalists worry that farming and industry just beyond its borders could have devastating impacts.

One concern is water abstraction, or the removal of water for human use. Although abstraction from the upper part of the delta is not a major concern, increasing industrial demands pose a threat for the future. For example, Angola, which is north of Botswana and where the water in the delta originates, is planning a major initiative to increase commercial agricultural operations. This initiative would draw water from the Okavango Delta and possibly affect the surrounding environment. There are mechanisms in place, however, to protect the water supply to the delta. If Angola, Botswana, or Namibia wants to divert water from the Okavango River before it reaches the delta, their plans need to be approved by the Permanent Okavango River Basin Water Commission (OKACOM). OKACOM’s mission is to promote economic prosperity, social justice, and environmentally conscious development of the Cubango-Okavango River Basin. To accomplish OKACOM’s mission, all stakeholders need to work together to find a balance between supporting increased agriculture in the region and preserving the integrity of the delta.
